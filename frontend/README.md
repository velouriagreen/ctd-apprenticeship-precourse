# Routes
1. Home (/)
Home is going to contain most of our application, showing us a list of all the products (products.tsx component). Will have the ability to filter by in stock or out of stock and by category. Also gonna implement sorting alphabetically. 


2. Single Product Page will be a dynamic route (/products/:productId). This page will contain the ability to delete a product

Example of a Dynamic Route: /products/1
Static Route: /home

3. Create Product Page (/create)

This page will have a few inputs that will allow a user to create a product. Some form of validation will follow after user creates a successful input.

(Look up mobile first design. Responsive as in it conforms to all types of screens UI Framework);
